# Whac-a-Mole

This Web App, was developed as a React-based Whac-a-Mole game, but later wrapped the react build with a nodeJS serverless backend that handles the high score database on MondoDB.
The game is really fun to play, so there is a deployment. I encourage you to set the high score yourself!

Some things I learned while making this:
- Generate components dynamically.
- Use state to track the score and mole status.
- Utilize the useEffect hook to govern the mole (component) lifecycle.
- Utilize the useState to hold object from back end
- hosting a backend on netlify
- making a serverless function
