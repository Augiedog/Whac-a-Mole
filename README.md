# Whack-a-Mole

This Web App, was developed as a React-based Whac-a-Mole game.
The game is really fun to [Play](http://mole-a-whack.herokuapp.com/)

Some things I learned while making this:
- Generate components dynamically.
- Use state to track the score and mole status.
- Utilize the useEffect hook to govern the mole (component) lifecycle.
