# React-a-Mole

In this activity, you will develop a React-based Whac-a-Mole game from scratch. You will use all of the concepts learned in this module.

You will:

* Generate components dynamically.
* Use state to track the score and mole status.
* Utilize the useEffect hook to govern the mole (component) lifecycle.
